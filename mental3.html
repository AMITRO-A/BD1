<h1 id="Diso">Type of mental health disorders</h1>
<h2 id="Ord">Anxiety disorder</h2>
<h3 id="H">According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are<br> the most common mental illness.
People with these conditions have severe fear or anxiety <br>related to certain objects or situations. Most people with an anxiety disorder try to avoid <br>exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.
Below are some examples of anxiety disorders.
<br>*Generalized anxiety disorder*<br>
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves excessive worry or fear that<br> disrupts everyday living.
<br>People may also experience physical symptoms, including:
<br>*Restlessness
<br>*Fatigue
<br>*Poor concentration
<br>*Tense muscles
<br>*Interrupted sleep
<br>A bout of anxiety symptoms does not necessarily need a specific trigger in people with<br> GAD.<br>
They may experience excessive anxiety when encountering everyday situations that do not <br>pose a direct danger, such as chores or appointments. A person with GAD may<br> sometimes feel anxiety with no trigger at all.
<br>*Panic disorder*
<br>People with a panic disorder experience regular panic attacks involving sudden, <br>overwhelming terror or a sense of imminent disaster and death.
<br>*Phobias*<br>
There are different types of phobia:
<br>*Simple phobias: These may involve a disproportionate fear of specific objects, <br>scenarios, or animals. A fear of spiders is a typical example.
<br>*Social phobia: Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of being subject to the <br>judgment of others. People with social phobia often restrict their exposure<br> to social environments.
<br>*Agoraphobia: This term refers to a fear of situations where getting away may be <br>difficult, such as being in an elevator or a moving train. Many people misunderstand this<br> phobia as the fear of being outside.
Phobias are deeply personal, and doctors do not know<br> every type. There could be thousands of phobias, and what may seem unusual to one<br> person can be a severe problem that dominates daily life for another.</h3>
<h4 id="Oc">OCD</h4>
<h5 id="O">People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have obsessions and compulsions. <br>In other words, they experience constant, stressful thoughts and a powerful urge to <br>perform repetitive acts, such as handwashing.</h5>
<h6 id="PT">PTSD</h6>
<h7 id="P">PTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses an intensely stressful or traumatic<br> event. During this type of event, the person thinks that their life or other peopleâ€™s lives are<br> in danger. They may feel afraid or that they have no control over what is happening.<br>
These sensations of <br>trauma and fear may then contribute to PTSD.</h7>
<h8 id="Sc">Schizophrenia disorders</h8>
<h9 id="S">The term schizophrenia often refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by psychotic<br> features and other severe symptoms. These are highly complex conditions.
According to<br> the NIMH, signs of schizophrenia typically develop between the ages of 16 and 30. The<br> individual will have thoughts that appear fragmented and may also find it hard to<br> process information.
Schizophrenia has negative and positive symptoms.<br> Positive symptoms include delusions, thought<br> disorders, and hallucinations, while withdrawal, lack of motivation, and a flat or<br> inappropriate mood are examples of negative symptoms.</h9>
