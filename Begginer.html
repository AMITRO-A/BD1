<h1 id="One">1.Create your healthy eating plan around whole,unprocessed foods</h1>
<h2 id="Plan">This is the golden rule of healthy eating. Follow this<br> rule and you’ll probably be following all the other<br> advice on this list. Whole foods are things like fruits,<br> vegetables, pulses and whole grains.
The best way<br> to stick to whole foods is to make everything<br> from scratch using raw ingredients. But that’s not<br> a very realistic aim! People rely on pre-made<br> foods for all sorts of reasons.
Instead, make healthier<br> choices.
Pay attention to traffic light labelling on foods<br> and favour those with lots of green.
Think about the <br>ingredients of what you’re about to buy: can you tell how <br>this was made? If not, there may be additives and<br> processed foods lurking in there.</h2>
<h3 id="Two">2.Goverment guidelines for healthy eating include your 5 A Day</h3>
<h4 id="Eat">We all know we should be eating our 5 A Day, right?<br> Well, actually we should be aiming for at least five.<br> When it comes to getting the vitamins and<br> minerals you need, the more fruit and vegetables the better!<br>
Foods that count as a portion are:<br>
*80g of fruit or vegetables (fresh, canned and frozen all count)<br>
*30g of dried fruit<br>
*150ml fruit or vegetable juice<br>
*80g beans or pulses<br>
You should limit fruit or vegetable juice to one 150ml portion<br> a day due to the high sugar content. Beans and pulses only <br>count as one portion a day however many you eat, because they<br> are lower in nutrients than other fruits and vegetables.<br>
If you struggle to eat five portions, try eating fruit or veg as snacks, <br>starting your day with a glass of juice, and making sure you<br> have at least two portions with both lunch and dinner.</h4>
<h5 id="Three">3.Add more fibre to your healthy eating meal plan</h5>
<h6 id="Fibre">The simplest way to instantly improve your diet is<br> swapping white breads, rice and pasta for brown or<br> wholemeal varieties. These all have much more<br> fibre in them than white options. Alternatively, seek<br> out ‘high fibre’ white versions.
Fibre is essential to<br> a healthy diet but around 90% of people in the<br> UK don’t eat enough.</h6>
<h7 id="Four">4.Don't eat too much salt,sugar or fat</h7>
<h8 id="Salt">WHO guidelines advise getting less than 30% of<br> your total energy intake from fats and less than<br> 10% from added sugars, and limiting your salt intake<br> to 5g (one teaspoon).<br>
*How to eat less fat<br>To reduce your fat intake, try steaming or boiling food instead of frying.<br> Use healthy fats such as rapeseed or olive oil in cooking.
Trim visible fat <br>from meat before you cook it, or opt for oily fish instead of meat. And cut <br>back on pre-packaged cakes, snacks and biscuits.<br>
*How to eat less salt<br>Pre-packaged foods also tend to be high in salt, as do processed meats<br> and – unsurprisingly – things like cheese and crisps that taste very salty.<br>
You can also reduce how much you add during cooking and stop adding <br>salt at the table. Your taste buds will adapt before long.<br>
*How to eat less sugar<br>Cut back on added sugars by avoiding sugary snacks such as sweets, soft <br>drinks, cakes and biscuits. Drinks are often the main culprit, so stick to <br>water wherever possible.
And remember, traffic light food labels highlight <br>the levels of salt, sugar and fat in many foods, so it’s always a good idea <br>to check them.</h8>
<h9 id="Five">5.Burn more calories than you consume</h9>
<h10 id="Cal">A healthy BMI won’t cure all your problems but it can certainly<br> promote good health. Maintaining a healthy bodyweight is one<br> of the best ways to keep your body fighting fit.
In order to lose<br> weight, you need to burn more calories than you consume.
The NHS <br>Eatwell guide has some great advice on getting started, but it’s always<br> best to seek advice from a professional.
Speak to your GP, who will help you<br> access the right advice for you, or book an appointment with a dietician.<br> They’ll give you a dietary consultation that will result in a tailored nutritional<br> plan specific to your individual needs.</h10>
