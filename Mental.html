<h1 id="M">Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers<br> and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your<br> family, live next door, teach your children, work<br> in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.
However, only half of those affected <br>receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached <br>to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher<br> medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment<br> opportunities and increased risk of suicide.</h1>
<h2 id="One">What exactly is a Mental Illness</h2>
<h3 id="What">A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes<br> disturbances in thinking, behavior, energy or emotion that make it<br> difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life. Research<br> is starting to uncover the complicated causes of these diseases which can<br> include genetics, brain chemistry, brain structure, experiencing <br>trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.
<br>The two most common mental health conditions are:</h3>
<h4 id="Anx">Anxiety Disorders</h4>
<h5 id="Dis">More than 19% of adults each year struggle with some type of anxiety disorder, <br>including: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),<br> panic disorder (panic attacks), generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobias</h5>
<h6 id="Mod">Mood Disorders</h6>
<h7 id="Dd">Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar depression, affect<br> nearly 10% of adults each year and are characterized by difficulties in regulating oneâ€™s<br> mood.</h7>
<h8 id="Cd">What you can do to help</h8>
<h9 id="H">Although the general perception of mental illness has improved over the past decades,<br> studies show that stigma against mental illness is still powerful, largely due to<br> media stereotypes and lack of education, and that people tend to attach negative stigmas<br> to mental health conditions at a far higher rate than to other diseases and disabilities,<br> such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease.
Stigma affects not only the number seeking<br> treatment, but also the number of resources available for proper treatment. Stigma and <br>misinformation can feel like overwhelming obstacles for someone who is struggling<br> with a mental health condition. Here a few powerful things you can do to help:<br>
*Showing* individuals respect and acceptance removes a significant barrier to successfully <br>coping with their illness. Having people see you as an individual and not as your illness<br> can make the biggest difference for someone who is struggling with their mental health.
<br>*Advocating* within our circles of influence helps ensure these individuals have the <br>same rights and opportunities as other members of your church, school and community.
<br>*Learning* more about mental health allows us to provide helpful support to those <br>affected in our families and communities.</h9>
