<h1 id="Five">5.Keep active wherever possible</h1>
<h2 id="Active">Regular exercise will make you feel so much better<br> and is crucial to staying healthy. And it’s still ,<br>possible to exercise indoors, however small your living <br>space.
Try online classes or video workouts, many of ,<br>which are available for free. There are lots available <br>that have been designed specially for people to do in their<br> living rooms without any equipment. Experiment until<br> you find one that works for you.
We are now allowed outside <br>to exercise as much as we like, so make the most of it with,<br> a brisk walk or even a run. Just be careful to stay two metres <br>away from everyone you see.
An hour of moderate exercise,<br> three times a week could make a huge difference to your fitness<br> levels.
Easy ways to stay active without leaving your house</h2>
<h3 id="Six">6.Sleep well</h3>
<h4 id="Sle">Sleep is often one of the first things to suffer when our<br>routines change. Try your best to keep to regular<br> sleep hours and to ensure you’re still getting 7-9 hours<br> a night.
Getting enough sleep improves your overall<br> health and protects your mental wellbeing.
Studies<br> have shown that sleeping well can make you happier,<br> improve your memory, improve your physical fitness<br> and help you maintain a healthy weight. 
A good night’s,<br> sleep can also boost your immune system.</h4>
<h5 id="Sev">7.Don't be too hard on yourself</h5>
<h6 id="Hard">Sometimes you’ll have bad days, you’ll feel rubbish or<br> you’ll make unhealthy choices. It’s not the end of the world.<br> Nobody’s perfect, and change doesn’t happen overnight.<br>
This is a really difficult time for everyone, so try to go easy <br>on yourself.
There’s no right way to respond to it and no doubt<br> other people are feeling the same way as you.
However, if you’re<br> really struggling then you should talk to someone.
If you <br>don't have close friends or family members to reach out to during<br> this time, find people you can talk to by looking for forums,<br> online help groups, or others who want to connect.
If you think you<br> need professional help, don’t let the situation stop you from <br>reaching out. Many mental health specialists have adapted to<br> offer counselling remotely.</h6>
