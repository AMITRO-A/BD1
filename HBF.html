<h1 id="How">Effects of Mental Health on Physical Health</h1>
<h2 id="M">Your mental health plays a huge role in your general well-being. Being in a good mental <br>state can keep you healthy and help prevent serious health conditions. A study found that <br>positive psychological well-being can reduce the risks of heart attacks and strokes.
<br>On the other hand, poor mental health can lead to poor physical health or harmful <br>behaviors.
*Chronic diseases.* Depression has been linked to many chronic illnesses. <br>These illnesses include diabetes, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. 
<br>Schizophrenia has also been linked to a higher risk of heart and respiratory diseases.<br>
Mental health conditions can also make dealing with a chronic illness more difficult. <br>The mortality rate from cancer and heart disease is higher among people with depression<br> or other mental health conditions.<br>
*‌Sleep problems.* People with mental health conditions are more likely to suffer from <br>sleep disorders, like insomnia or sleep apnea.<br> Insomnia can make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. Sleep apnea leads to breathing <br>problems, which can cause you to wake up frequently.
Around 50% to 80% of people with<br> mental health conditions will also have sleeping problems. Only 10% to 18% of the <br>general population experience sleeping problems.
While conditions like depression,<br> anxiety, or bipolar disorder may lead to sleep problems, sleep problems can also make<br> existing mental health conditions worse.
<br>*Smoking.* People with mental health conditions are more likely to smoke than those who<br> do not have mental health conditions. Among smokers, people with mental health<br> conditions are more likely to smoke a greater number of cigarettes.
People with depression<br> have lower levels of the chemical dopamine. Dopamine influences positive feelings in your<br> brain. The nicotine in cigarettes triggers the production of the chemical dopamine, so<br> smoking may be used as a way to relieve symptoms of depression. 
However, since nicotine<br> only offers temporary relief, you may feel a recurring need to smoke, which may lead to<br> possible addiction.
‌Access to health care. People with <br>mental health conditions are less likely to have access to adequate health care.
It may also<br> be more difficult for people with mental health conditions to take care of their physical<br> health When you have a mental health condition, it can be hard to seek care, take<br> prescriptions regularly,or get enough exercise.</h2>
<h3 id="Hh">Physical Health Conditions That May Affect Mental Health</h3>
<h4 id="Mm">Your physical well-being also has an impact on your mental health. People with physical<br> health conditions may also develop mental health conditions. 
Psoriasis is a dermatological<br> condition characterized by painful red sores on the skin. It is associated with acute stress<br> and depression.
Individuals with psoriasis experience emotional and psychological distress<br> that negatively impacts their overall health and quality of life. Stress and depression<br> mainly come from anxiety, stigma, and rejection.
Being diagnosed with cancer or having <br>a heart attack can also lead to feelings of depression or anxiety. Around one-third of<br> people with serious medical conditions will have symptoms of depression, such as low<br> mood, sleep problems, and a loss of interest in activities.</h4>
<h5 id="MH">How Both Factors Can Affect A Person</h5>
<h6 id="GG">How to Take Care of Your Mental and Physical Health</h6>
<h7 id="G">If you want to improve your general well-being, you should take care of both your<br> physical and mental health.
<br>Here are some ways to take care of yourself physically and mentally:<br>
*Get regular exercise. Exercise is important for keeping physically fit, but it can also help <br>improve your mood. A daily 10-minute walk may increase your mental alertness leaving you<br> energetic and in a good mood.
<br>*Eat a proper diet. A diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in processed sugars or fats can<br> make you feel better physically and mentally. Consider working with a qualified nutritionist to <br>help you create a diet plan customized according to your needs.
<br>*Avoid alcohol and drugs. Although drinking and smoking may make you feel better in the<br> short term, they can have a negative effect on both your physical and mental health.
<br>*Get enough sleep. A good night’s sleep is around seven to nine hours for adults. You can <br>also take a 30-minute nap during the day to feel more alert.
<br>*Try relaxation techniques. Meditation, deep breathing, and focusing your thoughts can all<br> help when you are feeling stressed. 
<br>*Develop good mental practices. Try to focus on positive emotions and events rather than <br>negative ones.
<br>*Seek help from others. Talking with friends or family members can help you feel less stressed. <br>Getting others to help with difficult situations can also reduce the burden you feel. </h7>
