<h1 id="Risk">Risk factors for mental health condition</h1>
<h2 id="U">Everyone is at some risk of developing a mental health disorder, regardless<br> of age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the developed world,<br> mental disorders are one of the leading causes of disability.
Social and financial<br> circumstances, adverse childhood experiences, biological factors, and underlying medical<br> conditions can all shape a person’s mental health.
Many people with a mental health <br>disorder have more than one condition at a time.    
It is important to note that good mental<br> health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements may contribute <br>to developing these disorders.   
The following factors can contribute to mental<br> health disruptions.</h2>
<h3 id="Soc">Continuous social and economic pressure</h3>
<h4 id="C">Having limited financial means or belonging to a marginalized or persecuted ethnic<br> group can increase the risk of mental health disorders.
A 2015 Iranian study <br> describes several socioeconomic causes of mental health conditions,<br> including poverty and living on the outskirts of a large city.
The researchers also described<br> flexible (modifiable) and inflexible (nonmodifiable) factors that affect the availability<br> and quality of mental health treatment for certain groups.
<br>Modifiable factors for mental health disorders include:
<br>*Socioeconomic conditions, such as whether work is available in the local area
<br>*Occupation
<br>*A person’s level of social involvement
<br>*Education
<br>*Housing quality
<br>*Gender
Nonmodifiable factors include:
<br>*Gender
<br>*Age
<br>*Ethnicity
<br>*Nationality
<br>The researchers found that being female increased the risk of low mental health <br>status by nearly 4 times. People with a “weak economic status” also scored highest <br>for mental health conditions in this study.</h4>
<h5 id="Child">Childhood adversity</h5>
<h6 id="A">Several studiesTrusted Source support that adverse childhood experiences <br>such as child abuse, parental loss, parental separation, and parental illness<br> significantly affect a growing child’s mental and physical health.
There are also<br> associations between childhood abuse and other adverse events with various psychotic <br>disorders. These experiences also make people vulnerable to post-traumatic stress disorder<br> (PTSD).</h6>
<h7 id="Bio">Biological factors</h7>
<h8 id="F">The NIMH suggests that genetic family history can increase the likelihood<br>of mental health conditions as specific genes and gene variants put a person at higher risk.<br>
However, many other factors contribute to the development of these disorders.<br>
Having a gene associated with a mental health disorder does not guarantee that a condition<br> will develop. Likewise, people without related genes or a family history of mental illness<br> can still have mental health issues.
Chronic stress and mental health conditions such as<br> depression and anxiety may develop due to underlying physical health problems,<br> such as cancer,<br> diabetes, and chronic pain.</h8>
