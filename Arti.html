<h1 id="Ttr">During times of stress and uncertainty, it’s easy to fall into bad habits and neglect <br>the healthy routines we’ve established. But looking after yourself is always important.</h1>
<h2 id="Ttr2">Maintaining a healthy lifestyle will look after your body as well as<br> your mind, making you much better equipped to deal with the <br>stresses and strains of everyday life.There are many ways you<br> can look after yourself properly. <br>We share some top tips to be healthy below:</h2>
<h3 id="First">1.Eat a healthy balanced food</h3>
<h4 id="Eat">What is a healthy lifestyle? So much of maintaining a healthy lifestyle<br> is about having a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables.<br>
Eating well is one of the best ways to look after your health. Many people<br> underestimate the importance of a healthy diet, but proper nutrition can<br> improve everything, from your energy levels to your mental health. It is<br> clinically proven that eating junk food regularly can impact your body <br>and mind, increasing the likelihood of depression and anxiety.
<br>Healthy eating is also crucial to the health of your immune system.<br> Try to make healthy choices wherever possible, eat lots of fruits and <br>vegetables and don’t eat mindlessly.<br> Your body and mind will thank you for it.
<br>Scroll down to find our top tips on eating healthily.</h4>
<h5 id="Second">2.Have regular meals</h5>
<h6 id="Stomach">Skipping breakfast or lunch can really affect your ability to<br>concentrate and work productively, as can replacing your <br>breakfast with countless cups of coffee. You may find yourself<br> getting headaches or feeling very sluggish.
Most of our routines<br> have been disrupted by the crisis, meal times included, but do <br>try to stick to regular times and take a proper break for lunch <br>whenever possible.
Eating at irregular times and wolfing down<br> your food has been shown to upset your gut (digestive system)<br>, which can affect the health of your whole body – not to mention <br>upsetting your stomach.</h6>
<h7 id="Third">3.Stay hydrated</h7>
<h8 id="Hydro">Drinking enough water is a crucial part of healthy living.<br> Studies show that drinking enough water can help you lose <br>weight, think more clearly, and avoid stress, among many<br> other benefits.
The government recommends drinking six <br>to eight glasses of fluids every day. Although people often <br>talk about water, most non-alcoholic drinks count.
So, if <br>you’re not a fan of water, stay hydrated with tea, coffee <br>and other low-sugar drinks.
It’s important to remember <br>that fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies, though they <br>do contain nutrients, are also high in sugar. You should <br>only drink around 150ml of these a day.
If you really miss<br> your sweet drinks, try sugar-free squash.</h8>
<h9 id="Fourth">4.Don't rely on comfort food,alcohol,cigarettes and the like to relieve stress</h9>
<h10 id="Relieve">If stress makes you turn towards salty and fatty foods <br>or causes you to overeat, you’re not alone. Similarly, <br>many of us try to manage our anxiety with alcohol or<br> cigarettes.
These things may all offer temporary relief,<br> but in the long term they’ll make you feel worse. Don’t<br> deprive yourself completely, but try to stick to healthy <br>choices most of the time.
Many people find that the 80/20<br> approach, which involves making healthy choices 80% <br>of the time, is an attainable way to do this.</h10>
